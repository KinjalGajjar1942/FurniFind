/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for furniture listings in the FurniFind app.
 * Data is nested under /users/{userId}/furniture/{furnitureId}, providing clear ownership boundaries.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}/furniture/{furnitureId}. This hierarchical structure ensures that
 * furniture items are directly associated with their respective owners.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 * - Authorization is enforced by verifying the user ID in the path against the authenticated user's UID.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: The design avoids the need for `get()` calls by enforcing ownership via path.
