    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to securely manage furniture listings, focusing on ownership and clear authorization. Each user has a dedicated collection for their furniture listings, ensuring private access by default. This approach leverages path-based ownership, simplifying security rules and eliminating the need for complex authorization logic. \n\n**Authorization Independence:** Authorization is achieved through path-based ownership, eliminating `get()` calls in security rules. Each furniture item is stored under `/users/{userId}/furniture/{furnitureId}`, so the security rules can simply check if `request.auth.uid == userId`.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** The structure enables secure `list` operations. A user can only list furniture items in their own `/users/{userId}/furniture` collection. To allow listing of all furniture (e.g. for a global search), a separate collection (e.g. `/public_furniture`) would be required with denormalized data, and its own security rules.\n\nThis design enforces clear ownership invariants, supports atomic operations (transactions/batches), and promotes ease of debugging."
